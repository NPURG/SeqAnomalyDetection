USAD_BiLSTM_VAE_Loss_design = '''
			The design of the loss function in the provided code is specific to the 'USAD_BiLSTM_VAE' model. 

			1. Mean Squared Error (MSE) Loss:
			   - The code initializes the MSE loss function using `nn.MSELoss(reduction='none')`. This means that the loss is calculated element-wise without any reduction.
			   - MSE loss measures the average squared difference between the predicted values and the target values. It is commonly used for regression tasks.
			   - In this case, the MSE loss is used to calculate two separate losses: `l1` and `l2`.

			2. Reconstruction Loss (l1 and l2):
			   - The code calculates two types of reconstruction losses: `l1` and `l2`.
			   - `l1` represents the reconstruction loss between the first autoencoder output (`ae1s`) and the input data (`d`).
			   - `l2` represents the reconstruction loss between the second autoencoder output (`ae2s`) and the input data (`d`), excluding the contribution from the first autoencoder (`ae2ae1s`).
			   - The weights `(1 / n)` and `(1 - 1 / n)` are used to balance the contribution of `l1` and `l2` in the overall loss calculation, where `n` represents the current epoch number.

			3. Kullback-Leibler (KL) Divergence Loss:
			   - The KL divergence loss is used to measure the difference between the learned latent space distribution and a predefined prior distribution.
			   - In this case, the KL divergence loss is calculated based on the mean (`mu`) and log variance (`logvar`) of the latent space distribution.
			   - The term `0.5 * torch.sum(1 + logvar - mu.pow(2) - logvar.exp())` represents the KL divergence loss.

			4. Overall Loss Calculation:
			   - The overall loss is calculated as the sum of the reconstruction losses (`l1` and `l2`) and the KL divergence loss.
			   - The code then takes the mean of the overall loss using `torch.mean()`.

			The design of this loss function aims to optimize the 'USAD_BiLSTM_VAE' model by minimizing the reconstruction errors (`l1` and `l2`) and aligning the learned latent space distribution with the predefined prior distribution (KL divergence loss). By combining these components, the model can learn to reconstruct the input data accurately and generate meaningful latent representations.

			It's important to note that the specific design choices for the loss function may vary depending on the requirements of the model and the nature of the data being used.
